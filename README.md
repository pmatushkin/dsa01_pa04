# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Algorithmic Toolbox Programming Assignment 04: Dynamic Programming
### Problems
Apply the dynamic programming technique to solve various computational problems:
* [`/src/primitive_calculator/PrimitiveCalculator.java`](src/primitive_calculator/PrimitiveCalculator.java): Problem 1, Primitive Calculator, computes the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number *n* starting from the number 1;
* [`/src/knapsack/Knapsack.java`](src/knapsack/Knapsack.java): Problem 2, Take as Much Gold as Possible, takes as much gold as possible into your bag (PASSED);
* [`/src/edit_distance/EditDistance.java`](src/edit_distance/EditDistance.java): Problem 3, Compute the Edit Distance Between Two Strings, implements the algorithm for computing the edit distance between two strings;
* [`/src/placing_parentheses/PlacingParentheses.java`](src/placing_parentheses/PlacingParentheses.java): Problem 4, Maximize the Value of an Arithmetic Expression, finds the maximum value of an arithmetic expression by specifying the order of applying its arithmetic operations using additional parentheses;
* [`/src/lcs3/LCS3.java`](src/lcs3/LCS3.java): Advanced Problem 5, Longest Common Subsequence of Three Sequences, computes the length of a longest common subsequence of three sequences.
